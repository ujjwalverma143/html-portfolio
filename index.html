    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p>Prepare the Dough:
        In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.
        Add warm milk, melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract. Mix until a dough forms.
        Knead the dough for 8–10 minutes on a floured surface or 5 minutes with a stand mixer until smooth and elastic.
        Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm spot for 1–2 hours, or
        until doubled in size.
        <br>
        Make the Filling:
        Mix brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.
        Spread softened butter evenly over the rolledout dough.
        <br>
        Roll and Cut:
        Punch down the risen dough and roll it out into a 15x10inch (38x25 cm) rectangle on a floured surface.
        Spread the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the buttered dough.
        Roll the dough tightly into a log starting from the long side. Pinch the seam to seal it.
        Cut the log into 12 even pieces.
        <br>
        Second Rise:
        Arrange the rolls in a greased 9x13inch (23x33 cm) baking dish, leaving space for them to expand.
        Cover with a towel and let rise for 30–45 minutes, or until puffed.
        <br>
        Bake the Rolls:
        Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
        Bake the rolls for 20–25 minutes, or until golden brown on top.
        <br>
        Make the Glaze:
        Beat cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl.
        Add milk, one tablespoon at a time, until the glaze reaches your desired consistency.
        <br>
        Finish and Serve:
        Spread the glaze over warm rolls.
        Serve immediately and enjoy!
